# ML-notebook
Applying my theoretical knowledge and learning/update ML packages (keras, tensorflow, pandas, numpy, ... ).
Focus on applying own ML-models, by gradually writing notebooks on tensorflows building blocks.

Will try to update continuously and use this repo as a good collection of my knowledge.
Will not go through the mathematical derivations, if not necessary or something I already have aspect on.
