# ML-notebook
This is not a full tutorial on ML, this is mostly for personal gain to applying my theoretical knowledge and learning/update my knowledge of ML/data science packages in python (keras, tensorflow, pandas, numpy, ... ). I did this because every time I look up a tutorial, they always go through the same notion of introducing a neuron etc. and are often unfocused. This will instead focus on going through the methods in the different packages, the underlying memory usage and later using those to apply own ML-models.

Will try to update continuously and use this repo as a good collection of my knowledge.
Will not go through the mathematical derivations, if not necessary or something I already have aspect of.
