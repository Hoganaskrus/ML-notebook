# ML-notebook
This is not a full tutorial on ML, this is mostly for personal gain to applying my theoretical knowledge and learn/update my knowledge of ML/data science packages in python (keras, tensorflow, pandas, numpy, ... ). I did this because every time I look up a tutorial, they always go through the same notion of introducing a neuron then define matrix multiplication etc. and are often unfocused on what is important. I will instead focus on going through the important function of the different packages, the underlying memory usage and later using those to apply my own ML-models.

Will try to update continuously and use this repo as a good collection of my knowledge.
Will not go through the mathematical derivations, if not necessary or something I already have knowledge of.
